# Azure Honeypot Lab

## 1. Overview

- **Purpose:** The purpose of this lab is to simulate a real-world threat detection scenario by deploying a honeypot in an Azure environment. This setup allows security professionals to attract and analyze malicious activity, such as unauthorized access attempts, network scans, and exploit testing. By understanding the methods attackers use to probe and infiltrate systems, participants can:
  - Gain hands-on experience with Azure security tools like Network Watcher, Sentinel, and Log Analytics.
  - Develop skills in detecting and mitigating cyber threats.
  - Strengthen their knowledge of network traffic analysis and attack patterns.
